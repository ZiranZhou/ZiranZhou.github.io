            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>In this project, I followed the instructions and the background introduction
                of the spec and explored how to use the recorded three exposures of the
                photos, and split them into their own channels of Red, Green, and Blue,
                which was not able to be physically recorded together at the time. But with
                modern day imaging algorithms and approaches, I was able to use the three channels
                to recreate the photos.</p>

                <h3>Splitting the image into 3 different Channels</h3>
                <p>
                    I read in the single image file that contains the three color channels stacked vertically, in the
                    order of Blue, Green, Red (BGR), then with the starter code provided, I was abel to split the image
                    into three equal parts, of three color channels, achieved by calculating the height of the image and
                    dividing it to 3 equal parts, and assigning each part to the respective color channel.

            <div>
                <h3>Aligning channels using Simple Translation Model</h3>
                <p>
                    After splitting the channels, I align the Green (G) and Red (R) channels to the Blue (B) channel as
                    base, and the alignment assumes that there is a simple x,y translation model, where the channels are
                    shifted horizontally and vertically to match each other so that the pixels of the original photo
                    match each other in terms of location, with the assumption that the translation is sufficient to
                    align properlly a visually correct RGB image.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Exhaustive Search for Alignment</h3>
                <p>
                    I used an exhaustive approach to align the channels to create the visually correct RGB image,
                    including shifting the image across a defined window of pixels of the range <code>[-15, 15]</code>
                    pixels in both the directions of x and y axis, and I calculated the Euclidean Distance (SSD when
                    squared) following the instructions, between the base Blue channel and the shifted channels of
                    either Red or Green to determine the best alignment.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Edge Detection and Border Artifacts Handling</h3>
                <p>
                    There were some issues arising in the implementation, mainly for the <code>emir.tif</code>, mainly
                    because that image has very varrying brightness values, so using only pixel values is not
                    sufficient, so just in case of other inputs with similar traits, aligning based only on the pixel
                    values does not always work properly because of the variations in teh brightness and color of the
                    pixels and to fix the problem. See Bells & Whistles section for more.


                    I used edge detection via teh Prewitt filter to
                    emphasize the structural elements of the
                    image, mainly the edges, which are consistent throughout the different color channels. The borders
                    of the image contain a lot of noise, so this presents anothe issue, so to properly align these
                    edges, I also ignored the border artifacts by a certain percentage (around 15%) so I have proper
                    alignment performance with less noise or fringe effects at the borders.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Pyramid Technique Optimization for Large Image</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the spec of the project, I utilized the Pyramid technique to optimize for the large
                    images, since the exhaustive searches become computationally expensive, as we start with a coarse
                    version of the image, which is downscaled using the package methods, and alignment is then performed
                    at each level of the pyramid so the displacement or shifting is refined as the resolution increases.
                    The downscaling is performed recursively, as the image progressively being downscaled, the alignment
                    is performed at each subordinate level, and the displacement at lower resolution is multiplied by 2
                    so we can apply to the higher resolution for refinement. Simply put, the offset found at the
                    recursive lower level is kept and used for the next pyramid search level.

                <h3>Dynamic and Fixed Border (Edge) Detection and Removal</h3>
                <p>
                    After splitting the image into the 3 color channels (B, G, R), but i use edge detection on each
                    channel using sobel filter. I also considered prewitt filter but sobel is said to have more response
                    and sensitivity to fine-grained details and and place a higher weight on central pixels of the
                    gradient calculation, and more useful in high-contrast areas than prewitt. This filtering asists in
                    identifying significant features of the image, and the maximum edge values across the color channels
                    are used to make a unified masking which is used to determin the region that I want to keep based on
                    the edges itensities and a threshold is used to decide that 95% will be kept since they are of
                    moment, and with this mask I extract the bounding box defined by outermost significant edges and it
                    determines the cropping boundaries, and I can eventually dynamically adjusting them based on the
                    image's content rather than the predefined margins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the dynamic fringe detection and removal is not enough. After that, the shifting on the R
                    red channel is slightly better, from <code>[132 -629]</code> to <code>[128 -388]</code>, but still
                    slightly off, so I had to reapply a prewitt filter for the shifted channel before passing into the
                    pyramid function, which successfully aligned the image <code>emir.tif</code>.
                </p>
