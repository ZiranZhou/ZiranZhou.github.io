            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>In this project, I followed the instructions and the background introduction
                of the spec and explored how to use homographies and perspective warping to obtain perspective-changed
                image manipulation results. </p>

            <h1>Part A: Image Warping & Mosaicing</h1>
            <h2>Step 1 - Shooting & Digitizing Pictures</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I shoot several photos using the camera on a camera stand being rotated around, then I digitizie the
                    photos and reduce the file size and image dimension for faster processing. The image set has 7
                    photos in total, including im-1.jpg, etc. Each successive pair of images have around 40%-70% of
                    similarity and I kept certain distinguishable features of the contents being taken so it is easier
                    to select mathcing corner and edge points as correspondences. Admittedly, the photos have different
                    lightings due to camera setting and environmental influences which may slightly influence the
                    warping and stitching results in later parts.
                </p>
            </div>



            <h2>Step 2 - Recovering Homographies</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In this part, I used the <code>sel_pts</code> and a series of other functions from Project 3 and I
                    was able to select, store, and reload correspondence points between every two images in a pair.
                    After selecting the correspondence points, for instance:
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="media/im1-im2-correspondence.jpg" alt="Image 1.2.1">
                    <p>im1-im2-correspondence.jpg</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="media/im2-im3-correspondence.jpg" alt="Image 1.2.2">
                    <p>im2-im3-correspondence.jpg</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I then work on image alignment via the point correspondences, and I developed the function
                    <code>computeH(impts1, impts2)</code> for recovering homography matrix \(H\) between the two images
                    we selected correspondences for, and it will create a 3x3 transformation matrix mapping
                    correspondence
                    points between two image.
                    We can also visualize it with the mathematical relationship:
                    \[p'=Hp\], where \(p'\) and \(p\) are (correspondence) points we selected for the two images, and
                    each point is represented in homogeneous coordinates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have the transformation as following:
                    \[
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    wx' \\
                    wy' \\
                    w
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    a & b & c \\
                    d & e & f \\
                    g & h & 1
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    x \\
                    y \\
                    1
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then for each correspondence pair, we record points of coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\)
                    from
                    <code>impts1</code> and <code>impts2</code> and we can expand the matrix multiplication write th
                    esystem as \(Ah=0\) where \(h\) is flaten \(h\) with the following 1st and 2nd rows:
                    \[
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    x_1 & y_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1x_2 & -y_1x_2 & -x_2 \\
                    0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 & -x_1y_2 & -y_1y_2 & -y_2
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h & 1
                    \end{bmatrix}^\top
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    x' \\
                    y'
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                    And we solve this matrix multiplication to get the homography-transformed coordinates to now how
                    each point in the image will be rearranged to create a chaneg in perspective of the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then solve the homography by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) where matrix \(A\) is decomposed
                    and the homograhy matrix \(H\) is then derived from the eigenvectors to the smallest singular value
                    of \(A\) which effectively minimizes error and obtain the desired result.
                </p>
            </div>




            <h2>Step 3 - Warp Images</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In this part, I morphed two images into one another using a sequence of transformations based on
                    specified control points and traingulation.
                </p>
                <p>I utilized th ehomography matrix H to transform the
                    coordinates of source image to target image's perspectvive and in the appropriate direction, i.e.
                    warping image 1 to image 4 then H is utilized, warping image 5 to image 4 then H's inverse instead.
                </p>
                <p>I also avoided loops for actual warping computation by using <code>np.meshgrid</code> and other
                    vectorized operations, and I also predicted the bounding box by transforming coordinates of original
                    images and calculate the extends of the resulting image.
                </p>
                <p>Note that the resulting image is not placed
                    in that extended background, but the information needed for blending is returned and will be handled
                    and associated with the extended bounding box in the <code>mosaic</code> function instead.
                </p>
                <p>I avoided
                    aliasing by using <code>scipy.interpolate.griddata</code> for resampling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that I excluded the 4th warped image from the display since it is chosen as the center so it is
                    not warped with a homography matrix but with an identity matrix, i.e., that it is not warped to any
                    different perspective.
                </p>

                    <div class="image">

                </div>
                <p>
                    I also used the homography functionality to achieve Rectification of images to desired
                    perspective.
                    The usage of homography in previous part was to find the projective transformation relationship
                    between 2 images with correspondence points detailing the levels of perspective adjustment.
                    However,
                    in this rectifying task, I do not use homograhy between 2 images, but one image and another with
                    correspondence points of a square or a rectangle, and choose ONLY 4 correspondence points (forming a
                    Square or a Rectangle to ensure rectified warping effects) on the
                    image whose perspective I wish to rectify, and I ensured the order of points are the same no
                    matter
                    the order they are selected. Afterwards, the image is being warped using the
                    <code>warpImage</code>
                    function to the square or rectangle perspective, which works especally well for images with
                    rectangular or square features before warping allowing for easy correspondence points selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the original images below have edges in a perspective that is non-parallel, and after
                    rectification, most of the edges are warped to parallel perspective and look more justified than
                    before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the following example of a image of a box and the resulting rectified
                    image.

                <h1>Step 4: Image Blending / Mosaicing</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In this part I used the <code>mosaic</code> function that takes in the results from
                        <code>warpImage</code> (for a total of 7 with the 4th one being the center image not warped
                        where each other image and their homographies are aligned to)
                        where I am able to access the coordinates that matter for the creation of the
                        dimension-extended
                        eventual mosaic canvas.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="media/ims-mosaic-overlaid.jpg" alt="Image 1.4.1">
                        <p>ims-mosaic-overlaid(123-2-centered).jpg</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We can see that the warped images connect almost perfectly, exhibiting the stitched result
                        resembling of a panoramic image. There are some slight misalignment of the images and some
                        differences in the pixel intensities which as described in the previous part of shooting the
                        photos that they could be caused by the camera setting and the environmental influences, and
                        the
                        alignment may also be affected by the number of correspondence points selected and how each
                        points are selected accurately enough which may not always be the case since it is manually
                        selected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I could also use Laplacian blending to remove the sharp edges contrast in the eventual
                        stitched
                        image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another result is the pictures taken at Salt Lake City Intl. Airport for a total of 4 photos
                        with the 2nd one being the center. The photos having some edges not being perfectly aligned
                        which is expected since I was not able to stabilize the phone for shooting them with perspective
                        rotated while keeping the center of projection identical throughout. But the main contents of
                        the image are maintained and are perfectly stitched together with the homography transformation
                        and the <code>warpImage</code> function implemented.

            <h2>Step 1 - Detecting Corner Features in an Image</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I detected all the Harris Corners on an image using the provided <code>harris.py</code> (in
                    <code>lib.py</code> file) which dots the entire image with points, which I will later filter out
                    most to select the most suitable corner points, as shown below:
                </p>
                <div class="gallery-row">
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="media/im1-Harris Corner.jpg" alt="Image harris.1">
                        <p>im1-Harris Corner.jpg</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image">

                        <p>im2-Harris Corner.jpg</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I then implemented the Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS) on the Harris Corner points to select
                    a subset of the corner points from an image. ANMS is designed to retain strong corner points while
                    ensuring that they are spatially well-distributed across the image, and this is crucial for tasks
                    like image matching and stitching which I implemented in later parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Harris Corners detection algorithm provided me a series of corner points and their corresponding
                    corner strengths.
                    I then ordered the corner points in descending order by their corner strengths and ensuring the
                    strongest corners are considered first during suppression process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And for each corner point, I initialize the radius to infinity as it represents the minimum distance
                    to a stronger corner point that satisfy the conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I also considered all previously processed corner points since they have higher corner
                    strengths
                    from being sorted first. And I calculated the Euclidean distance between the current corner point
                    and
                    each stronger corner point using the provided <code>dist2</code> function. Then I find the minimum
                    distance to a stronger corner and setting the radius to that minimal distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    \[
                    r_i = \min_j\{\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}\} \text{ for all } j \text{ where } c_j > c_i
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then calculated a minimum alloable suppression radius for the current corner point which is
                    proportional to its corner strength relative tothe max corner strength, by using the
                    <code>c_robust</code> parameter which controlls the sensitivity of suppression radius to corner
                    strength.
                    Then if the minimum distance (radius) is greater than the minimal radius, I update teh suppression
                    radius for corner point i, otherwise still set to infinity, and this ensures that only corner points
                    sufficiently distant from stronger corners and are beyond minimum allowable radius are considered
                    for selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, i selected the top 500 corner points with the largest suppression radii and are evenly
                    distributed across the image. See results below:

            <h2>Step 2 - Extracting a Feature Descriptor for each Feature Point</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I then implemented the Feature Descriptor Extraction for each feature point found in the previous
                    part to facilitae accurate image matching. I 1st convert the input image to grayscale if it is not
                    already to simplify feature descriptor extraction by reducing data dimensionality and use corner
                    points identified from previous ANMS result as centers for feature descriptor extraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each point, I extacted a large square patch around the feature point, chosen to have the size of
                    40x40 pixels to ensure sufficient contextual info around it is pertained and is essential for
                    creating stable descriptor. I also checked for whether or not the entire patch lies within the image
                    boundaries to avoid errors during extraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then apply Gaussian blur to the patch with the standard deviation (sigma) of the Gaussian kernel as
                    the parameter controlling blurring extent and helps reduce impact of noise and minor variations in
                    image making teh descriptor more robust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then i downsampled teh patches to have 0 mean and unit (1) variance (bias/gain normalization) to
                    make descriptor invariant to changes in lighting and contrast. I then flatten the normalized 8x8
                    patch into a 64 dimensional vector to represent feature of teh patch and a descriptor for
                    corresponding feature point.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 3 - Matching Extacted Feature Descriptors between two Images</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Then I implemented Feature Descriptors matching by identifying pairs of feature descriptors from 2
                    different images likely corresponding to the same physical point in teh scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each descriptor in the 1st image, I find the 2 nearest neighbor descriptors in the 2nd image
                    based on the <code>dist2</code> (Euclidean distance) function, and then I determined whether the
                    match is valid by calculating if the ratio of the distance to the neighrest neighbor to the
                    distance to the 2nd-nearest neighbor is belowed teh specified threshold, as proposed by David Lowe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using this criterion, I filter out ambiguous matches where closest descriptor not significantly
                    closer than the second-closest. I tested out several times and observed the empirical evidence and
                    differences between images
                    matched, and set the threshold value accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then also plot the matched points b/w 2 images
                    on a single image to visualize the correspondences, as shown below:
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Here I also implemented the same for the other image sets, here are some example shown:

                    It is obvious to see that the common parts of the 2 images have correspondence points capturing the
                    corner details and characteristics well, while there do exist some points that exist in one image
                    and not the other, which may cause some imperfections, but later it is shown that they have
                    miniscule effects.

            <h2>Step 4 - RANSAC (Homography Computation)</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I then implemented the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) functionality for computation of
                    homographies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I start by repeatedly selecting a random subset of matched point pairs (4 points) and compute a
                    homography H based on these sample points. I Then, for each sample, I use the homography function
                    from part A to calculate teh homography using the direct linear transformation. Then, I apply the
                    computed H homography to all the matched points and count how many of the transformation by H
                    able to create residuals below the threshold, and repeatedly I am able to find teh H that gives
                    the maximum number of inliers (i.e., points randomly selected but happen to fit well) and this will
                    be the best estimate under the specified number of iterations of random sampling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below I show the optimal points selected by RANSAC:

                <p>
                    And after calculating the optimal homography matrix, I can warp the images and create the mosaics
                    like part A before, as shown below. These mosaics look almost the same as selecting the
                    correspondence points manually, indicating success in the autostitching algorithms implemented.

                    center of projection due to difficulties arising in taking the photographs, but they are still
                    almost perfectly aligned in the mosaic.
